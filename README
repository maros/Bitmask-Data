DESCRIPTION
    This package helps you dealing with bitmasks. First you need to subclass
    Bitmask::Data and set the bitmask values and length. (If you are only
    working with a single bitmask in a simple application you might also
    initialize the bitmask directly in the Bitmask::Data module).

    After the initialization you can create an arbitrary number of bitmask
    objects which can be accessed and manipulated with convenient methods.

METHODS
  Class Methods
   bitmask_length
    Set/Get the length of the bitmask. Changing this value after the
    initialization is not recommended.

    Default: 16

   bitmask_default
    Set/Get the default bitmask for empty Bitmask::Data objects.

    Default: undef

   bitmask_complex
    Boolean value that enables/disables checks for composed bitmasks. If
    false init will only accept bits that are powers of 2.

    Default: 0

   bitmask_lazyinit
    Boolean value that enables/disables warnings for lazy initialization.

    Default: 0

   bitmask_items
    HASHREF of all bitmask items. Don't mess around here unless you know
    what you are doing.

   init
        CLASS->init(LIST of VALUES);

    Initializes the bitmask class. You can supply a list of possible values.
    Optionally you can also specify the bits for the mask by adding bit
    values after the value.

        CLASS->init(
            'value1'
            'value2' => 0x2 ,
            'value3',
            'value4' => 16,
            'value5' => 0b100000,
        );

   data2bit
        CLASS->data2bit(VALUE);

    Returns the corresponding bit for the given value.

   bit2data
        CLASS->bit2data(BIT);

    Returns the corresponding value for the given bit.

   bm2data
        CLASS->bm2data(BITMASK);

    Returns all the value for the given bitmask.

   any2data
        CLASS->any2data(124);
        CLASS->any2data('de_DE');
        CLASS->any2data(0b110001001);

    Turns a single value (bit, bitmask,value) into a value.

   _parse_params
        CLASS->_parse_params(LIST)

    Helper method for parsing params passed to various methods.

   Public Methods
   new
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new();
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new('value1');
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new('value2', 'value3');
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new('0b00010000010000');
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new(124);
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new(0b00010000010000);
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new(0x2);
        my $bm = MyBitmask->new([32, 'value1', 0b00010000010000]);

    Create a new bitmask object. You can supply almost any combination of
    bits, bitmasks and values, even mix different types.

    *   LIST or ARRAYREF of values

    *   LIST or ARRAYREF of bits (integers)

    *   LIST or ARRAYREF of strings representing bits or bitmasks (starting
        with '0b')

    *   LIST or ARRAYREF of bitmasks

    *   Any combination of the above

   set
        $bm->set(ITEMS);

    This method takes the same arguments as "new". It resets the current
    bitmask and sets the supplied arguments.

   list
        $bm->list

    In list context, this returns a list of the set values in scalar
    context, this returns an array reference to the list of values.

   length
        $bm->length

    Number of set bitmask values.

   first
        $bm->first

    Returns the first set value (the order of the values is determied by the
    sequence of the addition)

   remove
        $bm->remove(ITEMS);

    This method takes the same arguments as "new". The values supplied in
    the arguments will be unset.

   reset
        $bm->reset();

    Unsets all values, leaving an empty list.

   setall
        $bm->setall();

    Sets all values.

   add
        $bm->add(ITEMS);

    This method takes the same arguments as "new". The specified values will
    be set.

   mask
        $bm->mask();

    Returns the integer representing the bitmask of all the set values.

   string
        $bm->string();

    Retuns the string representing the bitmask.

   sqlfilter
        $bm->sqlfilter($field);

    This method can be used for database searches in conjunction with
    SQL::Abstract an POSTGRESQL (SQL::Abstract is used by "DBIx::Class" for
    generating searches). The search will find all database rows with
    bitmask that have at least the given values set. (use the "sql" method
    for an exact match)

    Example how to use sqlfilter with SQL::Abstract:

        my($stmt, @bind) = $sql->select(
            'mytable', 
            \@fields,
            {
                $bm->sqlfilter('mytable.bitmaskfield'),
            }
        );

    Example how to use sqlfilter with DBIx::Class:

        my $list = $resultset->search(
            { 
                $bm->sqlfilter('me.bitmaskfield'), 
            },
        );

   hasall
        $bm->hasall(ITEMS);

    This method takes the same arguments as "new". Checks if all requestes
    items are set and returns true or false.

   hasexact
        $bm->hasexact(ITEMS);

    This method takes the same arguments as "new". Checks if the requestes
    items exactly match the set values.

   hasany
        $bm->hasany(ITEMS);

    This method takes the same arguments as "new". Checks if at least one
    set value matches the supplied value list and returns true or false

CAVEATS
    Since Bitmask::Data is very liberal with input data you cannot use
    numbers as bitmask values.

SUBCLASSING
    Bitmask::Data was designed to be subclassed.

        package MyBitmask;
        use base qw(Bitmask::Data);
        __PACKAGE__->bitmask_length(20); # Default length is 16
        __PACKAGE__->init(
            'value1' => 0b000000000000000001,
            'value2' => 0x2,
            'value2' => 4,
            'value4',
            'value5',
        );

WORKING WITH DATABASES
    This module comes with support for POSTGRESQL databases (patches for
    other database vendors are welcome).

    First you need to create the correct column types:

        CREATE TABLE bitmaskexample ( 
            id integer DEFAULT nextval('pkey_seq'::regclass) NOT NULL,
            bitmask bit(14),
            otherfields character varying
        );

    The length of the bitmask field must match "CLAS->bitmask_length".

    This module provides two convenient methods to work with databases:

    *   sqlfilter: Search which have the current values set

    *   string: Print the bitmask string as used by the database

    If you are working with DBIx::Class you might also install de- and
    inflators for Bitmask objects:

        __PACKAGE__->inflate_column('fialname',{
            inflate => sub {
                my $value = shift;
                return MyBitmask->new($value);
            },
            deflate => sub {
                my $value = shift;
                undef $value 
                    unless ref($value) && $value->isa('MyBitmask');
                $value //= MyBitmask->new();
                return $value->string;
            },
        });
